Adafruit-Ultimate-GPS-Breakout-Board-Mounting-Clip
==================================================

This mounting clip allows you to easily mount and remove the Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout Board. Just attach the clip to your project with two screws. Then insert the GPS board. Mine was printed in PLA and I found it was easier to insert the tab first then align the pins.
